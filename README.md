Note: Uncrompress zip folder before opening otherwise css and java do not load properly.
To run open index.html

Inspired by the recent spaceX launch my webcite is about the intersteller flight of a ship to colonize mars. 
Most of the content is non-specific images of space and text. Some text provded by my little brother when I left the computer on when I went to work. Images from the NASA webcite.

-Index has the most drastic changes due to css.
  --Flexbox to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes.
  --Media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two and three coumn desktop layout.

-About has the working image carousel with at least three images.

-Tickets has the form that gives a random number and a finished java function that uses that number for another function that gives several diferent answers based on the nubmber.
